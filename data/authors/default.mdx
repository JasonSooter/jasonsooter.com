Hi ðŸ‘‹,

Welcome! I'm Jason. This site functions as a place for me to think in public.
I write about things I'm learning, things I'm thinking about, and things I'm working on.
This can be a bit of a mixed bag, but I hope you find something useful. I'd welcome any discussion you'd like to have.

Topics may include:

- Software Engineering
- Infrastructure
  - Cycling
  - Public Transit
  - Walkability
- Books I read
- Things I'm learning

Currently, I'm a Solutions Architect at [Twilio Segment](https://segment.com)

I live in Colorado, have a wife of 17 years + three kiddos and
I enjoy cycling (12 bikes of my own), reading, and basically everything outdoors.
